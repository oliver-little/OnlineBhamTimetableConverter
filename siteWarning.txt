Hi. Due to security concerns raised by the university you are advised not to get used to entering your details into websites not ran by the university. If you still want to use this service I would advise that you could first change your password at my.password then changing it back immideatly after using this service. This is simply because this site could be stealing your details; It isnâ€™t, but it could be. - Tom 09:20 20/12/18
